# Kaggle-RentHop
Work done for the [Kaggle Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries) competition. This was done with a team (see blog post link below), each of us doing our own work for learning purposes. That is why there is only one commit with all of our work combined.
